### 1. Via Palamolla

> Life is like a bird.<br/>
> One wing is truth, the other love.<br/>
> Lose one and go in circles.<br/>
> Lose both and drop like a rock.<br/>

I'm writing these words in a notebook while sitting in a somewhat uncomfortable pose on top of a cold marble bench surrounded by swaying palm trees on the beach walk in Reggio Calabria. Trying my best to look like I belong here to not draw the attention of the Police car that passes by with regular intervals, as well as timing my toilet breaks down by the water to not let anyone find my bags unattended.

It's three hours after midnight and the moon is still high in the sky, but I can feel the wind getting warmer and sense increasing activity from the awakening city behind me. I'm listening to the calm waves hitting the rocky beach in front of me, savouring the familiar scent of ocean and watching the glimmering lights on the opposite side of the bay; while finishing a bag of bread sticks and drinking cold water with chia- and sesame seeds that I was wise enough to bring along for the trip from my stainless steel cup; and occasionaly rolling a cigarette, more to break the monotony than because of nicotine cravings.

I'm freezing like crazy despite being wrapped in all my warmest clothes and my back hurts from sitting too much and carrying two heavy back packs containing everything I own for several days in a row. I arrived around midnight on an 8h direct bus trip from Rome, starving and still freezing from spending the entire night before in a bus tunnel outside Rome's central bus station to escape the cold pouring rain. I used the few Euros I had left after buying the bus ticket to get a cappuccino, a croissant, a bottle of water and some warmth and comfort for breakfast while waiting for the bus to depart.

With the night in the bus tunnel still fresh in my mind, I sacrificed what little dignity I had left to do a public announcement of my situation and immediate needs on the bus. But they just kept sitting there, eating their delicious Italian travel food as if I didn't exist. The complete indifference and lack of empathy felt like being hit really hard in the solar plexus; and not primarily for my sake, but for everyone out there having similar experiences every single day all over the world.

Once I stepped off the bus outside the train station in Reggio Calabria, I reluctantly approached the police car parked outside to ask for directions to the nearest homeless shelter. I've found dealing with the police in any country disappointing to outright dangerous. Many are simply pure bred fascists, and will turn you upside down and shake until they find a reason to make your life more complicated. Some are polite and will answer questions without attacking, but the answers you get tend to be less than helpful; they seem more confused about where they are and why then any regular citizen.

These police men were thankfully of the polite kind, and proceeded to pull out their phones and Google their way to an address about 20 minutes on foot from the train station. Via Palamolla, one of them said with a voice and body language of absolute authority and certainty. Straight forward, then turn right and there it is. Having been through this loop a couple of times already, and not really feeling like dragging my bags back and forth for nothing; I still figured it was the best option and started slowly walking in that direction.

About 40 minutes later, after passing several streets completely lacking name signs; I decided it was time to switch strategies and turned right into a maze of steep, narrow streets to look for someone to ask. I quickly ran into three black-dressed men in their early twenties who seemed somewhat disturbed by my intrusion into whatever no-good their were up to. Knowing that the only enemy in these situations is fear, I forced my heart wide open and greeted them as friends. As long as you can find the courage, I've found this to be pretty much fail safe no matter what you're facing. The back alley atmosphere instantly turned warmer and more welcoming, but unfortunately they had no idea where Via Palamolla could be found. Then seemingly out of nowhere, a fourth man entered the scene. Sure, he said; just right around the corner; and so it was.

After walking the grid and still not finding any signs of a homeless shelter, I knocked on the door of a four star hotel to find out more. I have to start by painting a picture of what walked in through the door in the middle of the night. I had been on the road for 7 days straight, sitting on busses, sleeping outside and carrying heavy bags back and forth. My last shower and change of clothes was 5 days earlier while waiting for my temporary passport at a homeless shelter in Rosenheim, a small town near Munich in South Germany.

Despite all of that, the well- dressed and groomed young man sitting behind the desk somehow managed to treat me with respect and politely and carefully listened to my story. He then turned to his computer while slowly shaking his head in disbelief; which is where the coined dropped for me, four star hotels and exclusive brand stores are rarely located next to homeless shelters from my experience. The shelters I've been unfortunate enough to visit were all located in the absolutely worst part of the city, and this clearly wasn't it.

As a last resort, I asked if he would consider calling the Police and check, since I don't speak Italian very well and my phone was running out of money. They promised to call back once they managed to locate someone who knew anything about anything. While we were waiting, I went out for a smoke; and just as I was about to return the door opened from the inside and presented a hand holding an espresso in a plastic cup, followed by my friend beaming with a new sense of purpose.

As I stepped inside sipping on my espresso, he almost started jumping up and down with excitement while pointing at the gifts he had carefully arranged for me on the reception counter. A bag of bread sticks, a litre bottle of water and two big apples. Once he got to the end, and despite my obvious gratefulness for his inspired act of kindness; he still seemed to feel something was missing and pulled out a â‚¬5 note from his pocket, and then asked to refill my tobacco from his personal pouch.

It was such a pleasure to watch him go through his transformation that I didn't want it to stop for his sake. He said the Police told him the shelter was located right in front of the train station. So I packed my gifts, looked into his eyes that almost had tears welling up at this point; and said thank you, you are a good man, don't forget. He then grabbed my hand and pulled me in for a warm hug.

Arriving at the train station, the shelter was still nowhere to be found; which was when I decided to go and sit down by the ocean instead to enjoy my gifts, watch the sun rise and start writing this book.
