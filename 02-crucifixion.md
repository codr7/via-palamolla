### 2. Crucifixion

> Improvise, Adapt, Overcome.<br/>
> Heart of fire, eyes wide open.<br/>
> Nothing can stop me now.<br/>

I spent most of the following day dragging my bags back and forth across town, looking for a Western Union office to make it possible for a friend in Germany to transfer donations from the Gofundme campaign I launched before leaving the country. Once I located an office, I was informed that withdrawing money using a temporary passport is illegal to prevent money laundering. It seems to me that if that was the real goal, the law would include a minimum amount to apply. The practical consequence is that once you're on a temporary passport without access to a bank account, you're on your own.

Somewhat frustrated I sat down in a park to reload in the sun and consider my options. As I was sitting there pulling off layers of warm clothes, a homeless immigrant approached me and asked if I could spare something warm to wear; as I had plenty and he was freezing. My first reflex was to put up my shields, since I was still very much operating in fight- or flight mode. But then I remembered my friend from the hotel the night before; and pulled out a cozy pullover filled with goose down and said here, this will keep you warm. For the entire time I sat there; my new friend was sitting next to me beaming like the sun and trying to keep a conversation going using the few english words he knew.

I used my €5 to get a delicious slice of pizza and an espresso to prepare for another night outside. My plan was to make my way up to the hotel around the same time as the previous night, hoping that my friend was working the same shift and could help me figure out a way to get to my final destination, Riace Superiore. Since I had nowhere else to go while waiting, I decided to head back down to the beach walk. By now I was so exhausted from not having slept for three days that all I could manage was to sit there eating my bread sticks and stare at the lights from the ferries zipping around the bay. It's a very weird feeling sitting outside the box and watching people inside enjoying their normal lives.

Once I arrived at the hotel, my friend was nowhere to be found. In his place was a older, less empathic man who listened to my story with a somewhat impatient but professional smile; but eventually warmed up enough to consider giving me water, bread sticks and fruit to make the night. As I inquired further about making it to Riace, he agreed to call a friend and try to get me on a bus for free. That didn't work out, as his friend wasn't driving the bus the next day; but he did provide me with enough information to find the bus as well as its departure time.

I stumbled out of the hotel and started walking in the direction of the train station, where the bus would depart at 5:30am the next day; with the goal of finding a safe space where I could snooze for a few hours before I collapsed. The polite police men in front of the station listened to my story and answered something along the lines of; shit man, total bummer, you can sleep inside the train station; and promptly resumed watching YouTube on their phones.

After failing to make myself comfortable and warm enough out on an abandoned platform; I finally gave up and collapsed in a pile on top of my bags in the least urine smelling corner I could find, right inside the wide open main entrance door. Before falling asleep, the last thing I promised myself was to end this nightmare the following day no matter what.

My phone managed to pull me out of coma just before the bus arrived. As I tried to stand up; I quickly realised that something was very wrong with my muscles and joints, and had to wobble back and forth along the wall for quite some time before my body started cooperating. At the bus stop, I was the only passenger waiting. The driver didn't speak any English at all; but once I said Riace, his face lit up in relief and he leapt out of his seat to help load my bags. He didn't even mention tickets or money, which was fine by me. The ride went through pouring rain from a dark gray sky up into the mountains, stopping in countless small villages along the way; while the bus kept filling up with Italian ladies carrying handbags, laughing and sharing the latest gossip.

At some point I fell asleep with my head resting against the window, and was woken up by the man responsible for selling tickets. When he realised I didn't have any money, he started swearing like crazy in Italian while bouncing up and down. I fully expected to be thrown off with my bags in the rain any second; but once he had vented his frustration and the ladies managed to calm him down, he was back to his normal cheery self again. At the next stop, the lady next to me discretely reached down into her handbag and handed over a €5 note. I gently touched her arm, looked at her and wispered thank you, and then she stood up and got off the bus.

When we arrived in Riace Marina at a café down by the ocean on the opposite side of the mountains, the bus driver leapt out and helped me unload my bags as if the ticket drama never happened. The girl working in the café said my final goal, Riace Superiore, was located 7km up into the steep mountains. I used some of the money to refuel, asked for a refill of my water bottle, took a deep breath and grabbed my bags. As I looked up an older Italian man was standing right in front of me with an admiring smile; very strong, he said, pointing at his biceps and my bags. He had no idea.
