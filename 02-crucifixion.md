### 2. Crucifixion
I spent most of the following day dragging my bags back and forth looking for a Western Union office to make it possible for a friend in Germany to transfer my accumulated donations from the Gofundme campaign I created before I left the country. I feel like everyone should try something like this without an Internet connection at least once to get an idea of how vulnerable we are.

Once I located the office, I was informed that withdrawing money using a temporary passport is illegal to prevent money laundering. It seems to me that if preventing money laundering was the true goal, the law would include a minimum amount for it to apply. The practical consequence is that once you're on a temporary passport without access to a bank account, you are on your own and the state couldn't care less about helping you.

Somewhat frustrated I sat down in a park to enjoy the sun and consider my options. As I was sitting there pulling off layer after layer of warm clothes, a homeless immigrant approached me and asked if I could spare something warm to wear; as I had plenty and he was freezing. My first reflex was to put up my shields, since I was still very much operating in fight- or flight mode; but then I remembered my friend from the hotel, pulled out my second warmest down pullover and said here, this will keep you warm. For the entire time I spent in the park; my new friend was sitting next to me beaming like the sun and trying to get a conversation going using the few words of English he knew.

I used my 5 Euros to get a delicious slice of pizza and an espresso to raise my spirits and reload for another night outside. My plan was to head over to the hotel around the same time as the previous night, hoping that my friend was working the same shift and be willing to help me figure out a way to get to my final destination, Riace.

Since I had nowhere else to go while waiting, I decided to head back down to the beach walk. By now I was so exhausted from not having slept for three days that all I could manage was to sit there and watch the lights from the ferries zipping around the bay.

Once I arrived at the hotel, my friend was nowhere to be found. In his place was a slightly older and less empathic man who listened to my story with a somewhat impatient but professional smile and eventually warmed up enough to consider giving me water, bread sticks and fruit to make the night. As I pressed further about making it to Riace, he agreed to call a friend and try to get me on a bus for free. That didn't work out, as his friend wasn't driving the bus the next day; but he did give me enough information to find the bus as well as its departure time.

So I stumbled out of the hotel and started walking in the direction of the train station, where the bus would depart at 5:30am the next day; with the goal of finding a safe space where I could snooze for a few hours before I collapsed. The polite police men in front of the station listened to my story and answered something along the lines of; shit man, total bummer, you can sleep in the train station; and promptly returned to watching Youtube on their phones.

After failing to make myself comfortable and warm enough out on an abandoned platform, I finally gave up and collapsed on top of my bags in the least pee smelling corner I could find right inside the wide open main entrance door. Before drifting off into a jerky and intense sleep, the last thing I promised myself was to end this nightmare the following day no matter what.
