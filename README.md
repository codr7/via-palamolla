[Analogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy) (from Greek ἀναλογία, analogia, "proportion", from ana- "upon, according to" [also "against", "anew"] + logos "ratio" [also "word, speech, reckoning"] is a cognitive process of transferring information or meaning from a particular subject (the analog, or source) to another (the target), or a linguistic expression corresponding to such a process.

### foreword
Analogistics is a book of authentic reflections on some of the ways in which our society fails to protect and support those who need it the most, reported from the bottom of the pyramid.

### support
Please consider a [donation](https://www.gofundme.com/f/analogistics) to help this project reach its full potential. While I'm open to the idea of eventually publishing a dead tree version, the full contents of the book will remain open source.
