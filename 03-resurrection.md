### 3. Resurrection
During the walk, I had to stop every kilometer or so to let my shoes dry in the sun and give my body a chance to regenerate. Despite barely sleeping and not eating nearly enough for three days, I still managed to appreciate slowly getting used to my new enivironment one painful step at a time.

Looking back behind me, I could see the bright blue ocean slowly being replaced by the winding road through endless rolling hills filled with olive, orange and lemon trees. The locals we're just getting ready to begin harvesting their olives by spreading nets under the trees. As a long time olive addict, I couldn't resist the temptation to try one directly from the tree; and was very disappointed to find out that they taste awful in their natural state.

Almost without exception; the people I met along the way, as well as the drivers of the vehicles that passed; greeted me like any other local. One young man I ran into while charging my phone at Rome's central bus station warned me about the wicked people down South. Watch out, or they will steal everything you own; he said with a serious look on his face. And always nod in agreement to everything they say to avoid getting into fights. I'm pretty sure the confused young man never actually went there himself.

Just as I was pushing through the final kilometers; a car pulled in next to me and an energetic, smiling woman jumped out to offer me a ride. She spoke a little bit of English and German; and on our way up, I somehow managed to transfer enough information across the language barrier for her to invite me to eat dinner with her family.

Their house was located some way down the opposite of the hill, and on our way there we traversed one seemingly impossibly steep and sharp turn after another. No one was wearing seat belts, but I doubt it would have mattered anyway.

As we arrived at the house, the family members we're just washing up for dinner that was being served inside. Sitting at the table and enjoying the simple but delicious stew of fish and potatoes with bread, olive oil and a glass of homemade wine; while trying my best to explain what brought me there; I could feel my body slowly shifting out of fight or flight mode and relaxing.

Once they understood my issues with transferring money from Germany, they graciously agreed to step in as middle men in the transaction. The man in the house remained somewhat sceptic and suspicious, as nothing about who I am or how I got there made much sense in his simple country side life.

After dinner and coffee, the entire family grabbed their gear and we went out in the fields to harvest olives. Despite feeling more dead than alive, doing something meaningful to help others and going through the monotonous motions turned out to be exactly what I needed.

Once the sun went down, and the olives had been carried back to the house; they drove me to The Global Village, an ant hill of ancient houses stacked on top of each other containing people from all over the world located in the center of Riace. On our way there, we passed by a small store to get some bread, salami, cheese and water to make sure I had food for a couple of days.

After a brief discussion between the husband and the manager of the villiage, whom he seemed to know well; the manager agreed to give me a place to sleep for a short while. Not really knowing what to expect, I was escorted down into the ant hill and finally arrived at a gate. Inside the gate was a set of stairs leading up to a house with a big, heavy wooden door; leading to a private two room/level apartment with a bed and shower, but not much else.

There was no heating and the building was falling into pieces like the rest of the village, but compared to what I had just been through it was heaven. Outside the apartment I found a lemon and orange tree, and proceeded to pick my first lemon and orange ever for evening snack. Once I done eating; I put on enough clothes to keep warm for the night, went to bed and slept in peace for the first time in three days.

As I woke up, the sun was shining in through the cracks in the wall around the windows. My body felt like it had been run over by a freight train, so I grabbed my phone and sent a message to inform the family that I was going to need a few days of rest before I could harvest any more olives.

I spent most of the day chilling in the sun outside the apartment, and eventually got bored enough to go for a short walk and start finding my way around Riace. On my way, I stumbled upon a tiny café/pizzeria with a welcoming atmosphere. The owner and what seemed like most of his extended family quickly got involved into making me a pizza with salami and olives that I paid using some of the money I got the day before after helping out with the harvest.
